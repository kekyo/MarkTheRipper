## What is this?

TODO:

MarkTheRipper is a very simple and fast static site generator
that allows you to write content in markdown.
The main intended use is for blog sites,
but we have eliminated the need for complex structures and tools anyway,
as if you were writing an article on GitHub Gist likely.

If you already have .NET 6.0 installation, you can install it simply:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g MarkTheRipper
```

Then at first time, you will need to run:

```bash
$ mtr new mininum
```

Will generate a template under your current directory as follows
(Don't be afraid! It's only TWO FILES with a few lines of content
and almost no extra definitions!)

* `contents` directory: `index.md`,
  It is a content (post) file written by markdown.
* `templates` directory: `page-template.html`,
  When the site is generated, the markdown is converted to HTML and inserted into this file.

That's it! Just to be sure, let's show you what's inside:

### index.md

```markdown
---
title: Hello MarkTheRipper!
author: Kouji Matsui
tags: [foo,bar]
---

# Hello MarkTheRipper!

This is sample post.

## H2

H2 body.

### H3

H3 body.
```

### page-template.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="author" content="{author}" />
    <meta name="generator" content="https://github.com/kekyo/MarkTheRipper" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="{tags}" />
    <meta name="referrer" content="same-origin" />
    <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>{title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    {contentBody}
</body>
</html>
```

If you look at the content, you can probably guess what happens:
MarkTheRipper simply converts the keywords and body into HTML
and inserts it into the template.
So, when customizing it for your site,
you can apply the various techniques used in common site implementations as is,
with few restrictions.

Let's generate the site as is. Generating a site is very easy:

```bash
$ mtr
````

If your directory structure is the same as the sample,
just run ``mtr`` to generate the site.
Site generation is multi-threaded and multi-asynchronous I/O driven,
so it is fast even with a large amount of content.
By default, the output is under the `docs` directory.

Site generation will delete all files in the `docs` directory
and generate them again each time.
If you manage the entire directory with Git,
you can commit the site including the `docs` directory.
Then you can check the differences of the actual generated files.
You can also push it straight to `github.io` and easily publish your site!

----

## A more practical sample

The samples generated by `mtr new minimum` are too simple (minimum is not a bad thing!),
but in case you want to see some more customized examples,
we have included two more samples as standard.
Two more examples are built in:

```bash
$ mtr new standard
$ mtr new rich
````

You can specify the sample `standard` or `rich`.
The following features are available:

* Add a navigation menu ([bootstrap.js 5.0](https://getbootstrap.jp/)).
* `rich`: Additional Japanese fonts (Noto sans JP) available.
* Fancy code blocks:
  * `standard`: Looks like GitHub's code block design (but does not have syntax highlighting).
  * `rich`: Syntax highlighting by [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).

In most cases, there is no problem starting with these samples.

## Install develop branch package

```
$ dotnet tool install -g MarkTheRipper --nuget-source http://nuget.kekyo.online:59103/repository/nuget/index.json
```
