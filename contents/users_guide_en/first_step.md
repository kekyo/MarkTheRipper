The first step to take immediately after installation is to prepare the necessary template for your site.
Don't worry! MarkTheRipper makes it easy to prepare the template itself.

## Generate a sample site

Then at first time, you will need to run:

```bash
$ mtr init mininum
```

Will generate a sample files under your current directory as follows
(Don't be afraid! It's only TWO FILES with a few lines of content
and almost no extra definitions!)

* `contents` directory: `index.md`,
  It is a content (post) file written by markdown.
* `layouts` directory: `page.html`,
  When the site is generated, the markdown is converted to HTML and inserted into this layout file.

That's it! Just to be sure, let's show you what's inside:

### contents/index.md

```markdown
---
title: Hello MarkTheRipper!
tags: foo,bar
---

This is sample post.

## H2

H2 body.

### H3

H3 body.
```

### layouts/page.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{lang}">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="{tags}" />
    <title>{title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p>Category:{foreach category.breadcrumbs} {item.name}{end}</p>
        <p>Tags:{foreach tags} {item.name}{end}</p>
        <p>
            {foreach (take (older self) 1)}<a href="{relative item.path}">Older</a>{end}
            {foreach (take (newer self) 1)}<a href="{relative item.path}">Newer</a>{end}
        </p>
    </header>
    <hr />
    <article>
        {contentBody}
    </article>
</body>
</html>
```

If you look at the content, you can probably guess what happens.
MarkTheRipper simply converts the keywords and body into HTML and inserts it into the layout.
Therefore when customizing a layout,
common HTML/CSS/JavaScript techniques can be applied as is,
and there are no restrictions.

(MarkTheRipper is written in .NET, but the user does not need to know about .NET)

Let's generate the site as is. Generating a site is very easy:

```bash
$ mtr
```

If your directory structure is the same as the sample, just run ``mtr`` to generate the site.
Site generation is multi-threaded and multi-asynchronous I/O driven,
so it is fast even with a large amount of content.
By default, the output is under the `docs` directory.
In this example, the `contents/index.md` file is converted and placed in the `docs/index.html` file.

You will then immediately see a preview in your default browser:

![minimum image](Images/minimum.png)

Site generation will delete all files in the `docs` directory and generate them again each time.
If you manage the entire directory with Git,
you can commit the site including the `docs` directory.
Then you can check the differences of the actual generated files.
You can also push it straight to `github.io` and easily publish your site!

There are no restrictions on the file names of markdown files or the subdirectories in which they are placed.
If there are files with the extension `.md` under the `contents` directory,
it does not matter what kind of subdirectories they are placed in,
under what kind of file names, or even if there are many of them.
All `.md` files will be converted to `.html` files, keeping the structure of the subdirectories.

Files with non `.md` extensions will simply be copied to the same location.
Additional files, such as pictures for example,
can be placed as you wish to manage them,
and you can write markdowns with relative paths to point to them.

## Daily operation

MarkTheRipper automatically recognizes all markdown files placed under the `contents` directory.
If you want to write an article,
you can simply create a markdown file in any directory you like and start writing it.

Is even this operation a hassle? Yes, of course we know.
So, there is an easier way to create and place markdown files so you can concentrate on writing articles.

```bash
$ mtr new
```

This will generate a template markdown file directly under the `contents` directory,
based on the current date naming, and automatically open the default markdown editor.
Categories will be discussed in more detail later,
but if you want to place articles in categories, you can use:

```bash
$ mtr new foo/bar/baz
```

Will place the article in the nested category "foo", "bar" and "baz" in the category.

## More practical samples

The samples generated by `mtr init minimum` are too simple (minimum is not a bad thing!),
but in case you want to see some more customized examples,
Several samples are built in as standard.

Two more examples are built in:

```bash
$ mtr init sidebar
$ mtr init standard
$ mtr init rich
```

You can specify the sample `sidebar`, `standard` or `rich`.
The following features are available:

|Name|Description|
|:----|:----|
|`sidebar`|Added sidebar navigation on `minimum` sample by CSS flex. If you want to design the whole thing from scratch, it is convenient because it does not contain any extra definitions.|
|`standard`|Looks like GitHub's code block design (but does not have syntax highlighting). Uses [bootstrap.js 5.0](https://getbootstrap.jp/).|
|`rich`|Syntax highlighting by [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/). Uses bootstrap.js 5.0.|

No need to worry. These samples have also been implemented
with the utmost care to keep the layout code to a simplest.
They are easy to understand and even HTML beginners
can start customizing with these samples.
